# Unweiling Online Deception : Fake-review-detection using Deep Learning Techniques

This is a thesis project done as part of Masters in Data Science Program in Liverpool John Moore University, UK.

**The research topic** : Fake Review Detection using Deep Learning Techniques.

**Aim and Objectives**

The main aim of this research is to study various machine learning and deep learning techniques used for fake review detection and come up novel approach that can be applied using supervised or semi supervised methods for unlabeled data.

• To analyze various Embedding Techniques machine learning and deep learning techniques for fake review detection.
• To propose a suitable feature extraction method and model architecture for fake review detection.
• To assess the effectiveness of different Embedding Techniques such as BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNET and machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Naïve-Bayes, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTM, BERT (transformer),  Adversarial Learning for automatic feature learning and complex language processing.
• To evaluate the overall performance of the proposed framework using appropriate metrics and validation techniques to assess its efficiency and accuracy in fake review detection.

**Data set** : Yelp data set is used for this thesis.

**Implementation**

This thesis has implemented  the Machine Learning algorithms, namely **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost** and Deep Learning Models such as **CNN (Convolution Neural Network), CNN-LSTM, RNN -LSTM, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** applied for the fake review detection. During this process various embedding techniques such as **TFIDF, Glove, BERT, ROBERTA, DISTEILBERT, XLNET** embeddings were explored. Balancing techniques such as ADASYN, SMOTE (Oversampling minority classes) were tested. Standard Scaler were applied for numerical columns. It is noted that Deep Learning Models MLP Classifier with BERT, ROBERTA, DISTEILBERT, XLNET Embeddings outperformed other Embedding techniques TFIDF and Glove on Machine Learning Classifiers.
